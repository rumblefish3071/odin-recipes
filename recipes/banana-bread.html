                    <p>Banana bread is a semi-sweet bread made by smashing overripe bananas and combining it with a bread batter. Most of the breadâ€™s sweetness comes from the healthy sugars naturally present in bananas, so it is considerably healthier than other sweet baked goods that rely on added sugars for their delectable taste.</p>
